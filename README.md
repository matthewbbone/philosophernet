# philosophernet

This project scraped an influence network of philosophers from wikipedia. The main goal was for met to get some practice webscraping, building a network, and turning it into a visualization. I chose this network because I've had an abiding love for philosophy and thought it would be interesting to understand the influence of a given philosopher from a network perspective.
